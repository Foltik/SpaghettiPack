# Foltik's Spaghetti Modpack
This modpack is designed to massively ramp up the complexity of the vanilla game with Bob's mods, Angel's mods, Yuoki Industries, Space Exploration, AAI, Logistics Trains, and more.

You can find it on the Factorio mod portal [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/foltiks_spaghetti_modpack).

I put this pack together to play with friends, so I will try to update it quickly whenever I find any issues during gameplay. If you find an issue, please let me know in the Discussions section!

If a mod is removed in a new version of the pack, you will have to manually disable the mod in your mods menu. An easy way to sync with the current version of the pack is to delete all of your mods, then re-download the latest version of the pack.
